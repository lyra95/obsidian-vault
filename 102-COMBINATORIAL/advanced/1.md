[comment]: # (custom-operation:: true)

For two sets of students $A$ and $B$ , let $A \cdot B$ to be the total score of students in $A$ against students $B$.

Then, following is true for arbitary set of students $A$ 

$$
A \cdot A = \frac{|A|(|A|-1)}{2} \tag{1}
$$

This operation $\cdot$ is quite natural in that

$$
A\cdot (B\sqcup C) =A\cdot B+A\cdot C \tag{2}
$$

where $\sqcup$ denote the disjoint union.

Let there be total $n$ students. Also, let $B$ to be the set of lowest 10 students, and $A$ to be set of the other students.

From the fact that each student get exactly half of his/her score from students in $B$,

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{cases}
2\times (A\cdot B) = A\cdot (A\sqcup B)= A\cdot A+A\cdot B \\
2\times (B\cdot B) = B\cdot (A\sqcup B)= B\cdot A+B\cdot B
\end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

which can be simplified as

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{cases}
A\cdot B = A\cdot A \\
B\cdot B = B\cdot A
\end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}
\tag{3}
$$

Now, let's see how this quantity $X$

$$
X = (A\sqcup B)\cdot (A\sqcup B)
$$

can be interpreted in two ways.

First, from (1),

$$
X = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
$$

Second, from (2),(3) and (1),

$$
\begin{align}
X &= A\cdot A + A\cdot B + B\cdot A + B\cdot B \\
&= 2(A\cdot A)+2(B\cdot B) \\
&= (n-10)(n-11)+90
\end{align}
$$

Solving the quadratic equations gives $n=16, 25$.

Let $S=A\sqcup B$.

[comment]: # (sanity-check:: true)
I. $n=16$

Again, from 1),2) and 3), $A\cdot S=30$, $B\cdot S=90$.

We can estabilish a inequality:

$$
\begin{align}
B\cdot S 
&= \sum_{b\in B}(b\cdot S) \\
&= \frac{10}{{10 \choose 6}6}
\sum_{\substack{C\subset B\\|C|=6}} C\cdot S \\
&\le \frac{10}{{10 \choose 6}6}
{10 \choose 6}
\mathcal{C}\cdot S = \frac{5}{3}(\mathcal{C}\cdot S)
\end{align}
$$

where $\mathcal{C}$ is the 6 students with highest scores in $B$. Simply, $54 \le \mathcal{C}\cdot S$.

However, $30 = A\cdot S \ge \mathcal{C}\cdot S =54$, which is a contradiction.

II. $n = 25$

It is possible. Assume $A$ against $A$, $B$ against $B$ are all tie.
