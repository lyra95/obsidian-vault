[comment]: # (custom-operation:: true)

For two sets of students $A$ and $B$ , let $A \cdot B$ to be the total score of students in $A$ against students $B$.

Then, following is true for arbitary set of students $A$ 

$$
A \cdot A = \frac{|A|(|A|-1)}{2} \tag{1}
$$

This operation $\cdot$ is quite natural in that

$$
A\cdot (B\sqcup C) =A\cdot B+A\cdot C \tag{2}
$$

where $\sqcup$ denote the disjoint union.

Let there be total $n$ students. Also, let $B$ to be the set of lowest 10 students, and $A$ to be set of the other students.

From the fact that each student get exactly half of his/her score from students in $B$,

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{cases}
2\times (A\cdot B) = A\cdot (A\sqcup B)= A\cdot A+A\cdot B \\
2\times (B\cdot B) = B\cdot (A\sqcup B)= B\cdot A+B\cdot B
\end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

which can be simplified as

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{cases}
A\cdot B = A\cdot A \\
B\cdot B = B\cdot A
\end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}
\tag{3}
$$

Now, let's see how this quantity $X$

$$
X = (A\cup B)\cdot (A\cup B)
$$

can be interpreted in two ways.

First, from (1),

$$
X = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
$$

Second, from (2),(3) and (1),

$$
\begin{align}
X &= A\cdot A + A\cdot B + B\cdot A + B\cdot B \\
&= 2(A\cdot A)+2(B\cdot B) \\
&= (n-10)(n-11)+45
\end{align}
$$

Solving the quadratic equations gives $n=36$. (the other $n=5$ is not the solution because $n>10$)
